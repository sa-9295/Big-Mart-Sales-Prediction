# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Using this model, BigMart can try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

The problem is solved in R. The solution contains implementation using:
1. Linear Regression
2. Lasso and Ridge Linear Regression
3. Random Forest with k fold cross validation
4. Support Vector Regression
5. XGBoost with k fold cross validation

Performed Data Exploration, treatment of missing values, feature engineering and then Modeling.
